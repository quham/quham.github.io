## Option 2: Netlify Forms (Alternative)

If you deploy to Netlify, you can use their built-in form handling:

1. Add `netlify` attribute to your form:
```html
<form netlify name="waitlist-signup" onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
```

2. Add a hidden input for Netlify:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="waitlist-signup" />
```

3. Netlify will automatically send form submissions to your email

## Option 3: Custom Backend (Advanced)

For a production app, you might want:
- Node.js + Express backend
- Email service like SendGrid or AWS SES
- Database to store signups
- Rate limiting and spam protection

---

## Troubleshooting

### EmailJS Issues:
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify all IDs and keys are correct
- Ensure your email service is properly connected
- Check spam folder

### Common Problems:
- **"Service not found"**: Check your Service ID
- **"Template not found"**: Check your Template ID  
- **"Invalid key"**: Check your Public Key
- **"Authentication failed"**: Reconnect your email service

### Security Notes:
- Your Public Key is safe to expose in frontend code
- Never expose Service IDs or Template IDs in public repositories
- Consider rate limiting to prevent spam
